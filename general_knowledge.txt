any class that extends pytorch nn.Module means this class is representing a neural network. 
that means you must define the forward function for how data passes through it and then pytorch
will let you instantiate it as a model that can take input like in the example below:

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):  # Extends nn.Module
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()  # Calls the parent class constructor
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size) 
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size) 

    def forward(self, x):  # Defines the forward pass
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x)) 
        x = self.fc2(x) 
        return x

model = SimpleNN(input_size=4, hidden_size=10, output_size=3)
sample_input = torch.randn(1, 4)  
output = model(sample_input)  

it also means pytorch will update the params (eg fc1 and fc2 above) for u do u dont have to.
